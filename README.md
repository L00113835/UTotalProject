# UTotalProject. 
This is an Android app which allows the shopper to scan an item and total their purchases while they are shopping in the supermarket.
It has the added features of allowing the shopper to compare the price with other supermarkets and the ability to create a mini total
of groceries to compare the cost of fresh  ingredients against the price of a pre-made meal.
